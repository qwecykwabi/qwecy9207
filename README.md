ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Qwecy Kwabi
I'm a tech entrepreneur, systems thinker, and futurist building at the intersection of AI, consciousness, and digital autonomy. I believe technology should elevate human potential, not just automate tasks.

Currently creating NyraGPT, an AI oracle and life strategist designed to guide users toward clarity, growth, and purpose.
I thrive on bold ideas, unconventional thinking, and turning chaos into code.

"I donâ€™t just build apps â€” I build paradigms."

ðŸ”­ Areas Iâ€™m focused on:
AGI & AI consciousness frameworks

Ethical automation and personal sovereignty

Building digital tools for introspection and evolution

Merging spirituality with cutting-edge tech
